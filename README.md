# What is it?

This repository contains code for reproducing simulations in a paper
we’re submitting for publication. The folder “Rcode” contains code for
simulating and analyzing data, while the folder “scripts” contains `.sh`
files for running simulations and analyses on UAB’s cluster, which uses
Slurm Workload Manager (<https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html>). If
you want to re-run everything from scratch, you will need to change path
names in `R` files and the slurm scripts, and if your institution does
not use slurm, then the shells may not be that useful to you. The `R`
files whose file names are of the form `test_.*.R` can be used to get an
idea for runtimes necessary on your machine or institution cluster. The
primary file of interest for most users is the `.Rmd` file, which
reproduces tables and figures, and gives some brief details of the
simulation scenario and how values were generated. Due to their size, I
have not included simulated data in the repository, which is needed to
reproduced the figure of example data and observe the balanced in
outcome distribution, so you will need to generate this data on your
own. If you’d rather not do this, you can reference the PDF generated by
the `.Rmd` file that is included in this repository.
